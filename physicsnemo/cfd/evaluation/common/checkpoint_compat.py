"""PyTorch 2.6+ compatibility for loading full training checkpoints (not weights-only).

``physicsnemo.utils.load_checkpoint`` uses ``torch.load`` without ``weights_only``.
Since PyTorch 2.6 the default is ``weights_only=True``, which fails on checkpoints that
contain OmegaConf objects and other metadata. Wrap those loads with
:func:`trusted_torch_load_context`.
